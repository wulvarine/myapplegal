  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">App: Conscious Kitchen (package: <code>menu_mate</code>) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: 14 June 2026</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <strong>In short:</strong> Conscious Kitchen does not require an account, does not use analytics or
    advertising, and does not sell your data. Your meal plans, recipes, preferences and cook history are
    stored only on your device. Voice and pantry-matching features send the minimum necessary text or
    audio to an AI service to generate a response, and that data is not stored or used to identify you.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Conscious Kitchen is developed by an independent developer. If you have questions about this policy
    or how the app handles your information, contact:
    <a href="mailto:vinothkcg@gmail.com">vinothkcg@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data stored on your device</h2>
  <p>
    The app stores the following information locally on your device, using a local database
    (SQLite) and app preferences storage. This data is <strong>never transmitted to us</strong> and is
    not accessible to anyone else — it stays on your phone unless you choose to export or share it.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name (optional, used only for greetings within the app)</li>
    <li>Your weekly meal plans, busy-day settings, and cooking history</li>
    <li>Dietary preferences (vegetarian / non-vegetarian / egg days), cuisine preferences, and dish
        likes/dislikes</li>
    <li>Recipes you create or import, including any audio recordings you choose to save with a recipe</li>
    <li>Grocery list items and pantry notes you enter</li>
    <li>Cooking streaks and notification settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Uninstalling the app permanently deletes this data from your device. The app also includes an
    export/backup feature — any file you create with it is saved to your device's storage and is
    under your control.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data sent to AI services</h2>
  <p>
    Certain features use an AI assistant (currently powered by Groq) to generate suggestions. To keep
    your API access secure, these requests are routed through a small proxy server that we operate
    (a Cloudflare Worker) — the AI provider itself never receives your name or device identifiers.
  </p>
  <h3>Pantry / "what can I cook" matching</h3>
  <p>
    When you type or speak a list of ingredients you have on hand, that text (plus the names of the
    recipes already in the app) is sent to the AI service to find matching recipes or suggest new
    ones. No other personal information is included in this request.
  </p>
  <h3>Voice search and voice recipe entry</h3>
  <p>
    If you use a microphone-based feature (voice search, or recording a recipe to add to the app), the
    audio is sent to the AI service for transcription, and the resulting text may be sent again to
    generate structured recipe data (ingredients and steps). The audio recording is processed to
    produce text and is not retained by us after the request completes.
  </p>
  <h3>Recipe generation and cooking steps</h3>
  <p>
    When you ask the app to generate details or step-by-step instructions for a dish, only the dish
    name (and, for cooking steps, the recipe name) is sent to the AI service.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of these requests include your name, email address, location, or any device identifier.
    We do not use the content of these requests for any purpose other than returning a response to
    your device, and we do not build a profile of you from them.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Shared content and recipe links</h2>
  <p>
    If you share a link (for example, from Instagram or YouTube) or a text snippet to Conscious
    Kitchen from another app, that content is used only to help you save or view the recipe — for
    example, by opening the link in an in-app browser or sending the text to the AI service (see
    Section 3) to extract ingredients and steps. This content is not stored by us beyond what is
    saved to your local recipe library on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    The app schedules local reminders (e.g. meal prep reminders, "what's for dinner" nudges, and
    cooking streak reminders) directly on your device using Android's notification system. These
    notifications are generated and delivered entirely on-device and are not sent through any
    server.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Permissions the app uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet</strong> — required for the AI-powered features described in Section 3 and for
        loading shared recipe links.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong> — used only when you actively start a voice search or voice recipe
        recording.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications, exact alarms, boot start, wake lock</strong> — used to schedule and
        deliver the local meal/prep reminders described in Section 5, including after your device
        restarts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. What we don't do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require account creation, sign-in, or any persistent user identifier.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics, crash-reporting, or advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>We do not track you across other apps or websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Conscious Kitchen is a household meal-planning tool intended for general audiences and is not
    directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this same URL with a revised
    "Last updated" date.
